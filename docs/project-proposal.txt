Idea 1: Beer Rating App
* Premise: good reads for beer
  - Allows users to create a wishlist of beers
  - Allows user to review beers they have already tried
* Potential implementations:
  - Locate specific beer nearby
  - User uploads photos of beer
  - Add a beer if it's not already on the app 
  - Follow other users
  - Establishment specific profiles to upload their beers, rate their beers, etc
  - Within wishlist have google maps for nearby purchases/drizzly delivery
* Database:
  - Beer database for all beers and their descriptions
  - Person database to store beers they have tried, reviewed, and added to wishlist
* APIs:
  - Beer api - https://sampleapis.com/api-list/beers
  - Google maps 
  - Camera api
  - Drizly api - https://rapidapi.com/blog/directory/drizly/
